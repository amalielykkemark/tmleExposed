Description: The \code{tmle_exposed} is a Targeted Minumum-loss based estimator (TMLE) for estimating effects of interventions targeting an intermediate factor in a high risk population (the exposed). The intermediate factor (Z) could be an intervenable variable as, i.e. treatment access, and is an effect of the exposure (A) and a cause of the outcome (Y), A -> Z ->Y. The function \code{tmle_exposed} allows the user to estimate effects of a stochastic or deterministic intervention on the intermediate. If '\code{intervention='unexposed'}, then the estimated parameter is the expected change in outcome risk under a stochastic intervention among the exposed (A=1) where the exposed probability of the intermediate (Z) variable became as observed among the unexposed (A=0).
